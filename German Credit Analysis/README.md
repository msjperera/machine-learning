# Task
## Question 1
### (1)
Fit a decision tree to the training data with an optimal tree size determined by 10-fold cross-validation. Create a plot of the pruned tree and interpret the results. If cross-validation does not lead to selection of a pruned tree, then create a pruned tree with five terminal nodes. Compute the test error rate of the pruned tree.
### (2)
Fit a random forest to the training data with parameter tuned by 10-fold crossvalidation. Compute the test error rate and comment on the results. Create a plot showing variable importance for the model with the tuned parameter and comment on the plot.
### (3)
Draw one plot with two ROC curves for the test predictions in (1) and (2). Comment on the plot.

## Question 2
Simulate a three-class dataset with 50 observations in each class and two features. Make
sure that this dataset is not linearly separable. Make a scatter plot to show your dataset.
Split the dataset to a training set (50%) and a test set (50%). Train the support vector
machine with a polynomial kernel and an RBF kernel, as well as a support vector classifier
on the training data. The parameters associated with each model should be tuned by 5-fold
cross-validation. Test the models on the test data and comment on the results.
